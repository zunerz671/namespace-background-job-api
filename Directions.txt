Exercise:
Create a brand new rails api
rails new namespace-background-job-api --api --database=postgresql
Push it up to GitHub
Get it started
Create the db
Create the product model
Migrate it
Test it in rails console (create a product)
Create the products controller in the api/v1 namespace
rails g controller api/v1/products
Add the index and create actions
Add the routes for it (in the correct namespace):
 Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # regular products controller
  get "/products" => "products#index"

  # namespaced products controller
  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      get "/products" => "products#index"
      post "/products" => "products#create"
      get "/products/:id" => "products#show"
      put "/products/:id" => "products#update"
      delete "/products/:id" => "products#destroy"

      resources :products, only: [:index, :create]

    end
  end
end
Test it all out in HTTPie

Bonus:
Test it out using resources instead of writing out the explicit routes
Create another namespace for admins and add a controller and route/s for it
